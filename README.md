# 📈 Advanced Stock Market Predictor

A comprehensive stock market analysis and prediction application built with Streamlit, featuring machine learning models, technical analysis, and interactive visualizations. The idea came to me since I just started Investing and wanted to build just a simple predictor!
Thought it would be a cool idea and since I learned most of my information with Python when it comes to API's and data virtulization went ahead and gave it my best shot. Let me know how it went!
